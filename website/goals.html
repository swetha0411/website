   <h2>  Problem-Solving and Decision Making</h2>
   <p> One of the central aims of AI is to develop systems that can analyze large datasets, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions. This ability to solve problems and make decisions efficiently is invaluable across various industries, from healthcare and finance to transportation and manufacturing.</p>
   <h2>  Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2>
   <p> AI-driven NLP is a critical aspect of creating machines that can understand and communicate with humans in natural language. NLP enables virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to comprehend user queries and respond appropriately, making machine interactions more intuitive and user-friendly.</p>
   <h2> Perception</h2>
   <p>Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.
    
    The field includes speech recognition, image classification, facial recognition, object recognition, and robotic perception. </p>
    <h2> Social intelligence </h2>
    <p>Affective computing  is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.[64] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.

        However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subjec</p>
        <h2> Learning</h2>
        <p> Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e]

            There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[44] Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[45]
            
            In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good".[46] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[47] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.[48]
            
            Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization</p>
            <h2> General intelligence</h2>
            <p> A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.</p>
