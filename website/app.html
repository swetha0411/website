  <center> <h1> APPLICATIONS OF AI</h1></center>
 <center> <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*tqnppBAx4jq5dR3g"/></center>
 <p> AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok).</p>
 <h2> Health and Medicine</h2>
 <p> The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life.[126] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.

    For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating Big Data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication.[127] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research.[127] New AI tools can deepen our understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.[128] In 2023 it was reported that AI guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria</p>
    <h2>Military</h2>
    <p>Various countries are deploying AI military applications. The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams. AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria. </p>
    <h2>Generative AI </h2>
    <p> In the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence. ChatGPT, based on GPT-3, and other large language models, were tried by 14% of Americans adults. The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos. Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat, the fictional arrest of Donald Trump, and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon, as well as the usage in professional creative arts.</p>
    <h2> Social Media</h2>
    <p> Cameras and apps use AI for applying different effects on images, refining their quality, and even suggest how to click them live!

        AI can help in object identification in images and also enhance the photograph to the maximum extent by identifying the depth, lighting, and scope of the picture, and helping capture every element in as much detail as possible. By using this feature, many apps and cameras let you add a variety of effects in your pictures.</p>
    <h2> Agriculture</h2>
    <p> One of the latest artificial intelligence applications, Agriculture, has also shown a significant impact on the industry.

        With the increased demand for food, organizations are using automation and robotics technology with AI embedded in it to help farmers find more efficient ways to protect their crops from various elements like weather, weeds, market consumption rates, and much more.
        
        Issues such as climate change, population growth, and food security concerns have pushed the industry into seeking more innovative approaches to improve crop yield and targeted production.
        
        This AI applications in real life, in the form of image recognition, identify possible defects in the crops through images captured by the userâ€™s smartphone camera. Users are then provided with soil restoration techniques, tips, and other possible solutions to deal with the identified defects.
        
        </p>
       <h2>Video Games</h2> 
       <p> Over the past few years, artificial intelligence has become an integral part of the gaming industry. In fact, one of the biggest accomplishments of AI is in the gaming industry.</p>
       <p> The gaming world is the best example of intelligent real world AI applications as it is at this platform where there are a lot of alterations in the purpose. AI is used for designing the game, developing the characters, and also frame the story to a certain extent.</p>
